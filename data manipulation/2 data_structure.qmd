This document provides a detailed overview of the fundamental data structures in R. Understanding these structures is essential for effective programming and data analysis in R. Each structure has its own strengths and is suited for different types of tasks.

# 1. Vectors

A vector is a one-dimensional, ordered collection of elements. A key characteristic of vectors is that all elements must be of the same data type (**homogeneous**). They are the simplest and most common data structure in R.

### Creating Vectors

Vectors are typically created with the `c()` (combine) function.

```{r}
# A numeric vector
numeric_vector <- c(10.5, 2.3, 15.0, 4.8)
numeric_vector

# A character vector
character_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
character_vector

# A logical vector
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
logical_vector
```


#### Sequence Vector

The `seq()` function generates a sequence of numbers.

```{r}
seq(from = 2, to = 14, by = 2) 
```

#### Replicated Vector

The `rep()` function repeats a value a specified number of times.

```{r}
rep(x = 1.5, times = 4)  
```

#### Random Vector

The `sample()` function takes a random sample from a set of elements. `replace = FALSE` means each element can only be chosen once.

```{r}
sample(1:10, 5, replace = FALSE) 
```

With `replace = TRUE`, elements can be chosen multiple times.

```{r}
sample(1:10, 5, replace = TRUE) 
```

`runif()` generates random numbers from a uniform distribution.

```{r}
runif(1, min = 0, max = 1)
```

`rnorm()` generates random numbers from a normal distribution.

```{r}
sn1 <- rnorm(4, mean = 0, sd = 1) # Standard normal distribution
sn1
```

#### Unique Vector

The `unique()` function removes duplicate elements from a vector.

```{r}
v1 = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 6)
v1
```

```{r}
unique(v1)
```



### Type Coercion

If you try to mix types, R will **coerce** the elements to the most flexible type in a specific hierarchy: `logical` -> `integer` -> `numeric` -> `character`. For example, mixing numbers and characters will result in a character vector because character is the most flexible type.

```{r}
mixed_vector <- c(1, "apple", 3.5, TRUE)
class(mixed_vector) # All elements are now characters
mixed_vector
```

### Vector Operations

Mathematical and logical operations on vectors are performed element-wise. This is a powerful feature called vectorization, which is much faster than writing a loop.

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(10, 20, 30)

a + b # Element-wise addition
a * 10 # Scalar multiplication is applied to each element
```

### Subsetting Vectors

You can select elements from a vector using their index inside square brackets `[]`. R uses 1-based indexing.

```{r}
character_vector[2] # Select the second element

numeric_vector[c(1, 3)] # Select the first and third elements

numeric_vector[numeric_vector > 10] # Select elements based on a logical condition

# You can also exclude elements using negative indices
numeric_vector[-2] # Exclude the second element
```




### Append Vector

You can combine vectors by using the `c()` function.

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3)
y = c(4, 5, 6)
z = c(x, y)
z
```

### Remove Elements from a Vector

Negative indexing removes elements at the specified positions.

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x
```

Remove the first element:

```{r}
x[-1]
```

Remove the last element:

```{r}
x[-length(x)]
```

Remove elements based on a vector of indices:

```{r}
remove = c(2, 4)
x[-remove]
```

### Sort Vector

`sort()` arranges vector elements in ascending or descending order.

```{r}
a = c(2, 4, 6, 1, 4)
sort(a)
```

```{r}
sort(a, decreasing = TRUE)
```

### Vector Length

`length()` returns the number of elements in a vector.

```{r}
length(a)
```

### Vector Calculation

Mathematical functions can be applied to entire vectors.

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
sum(x)
```

### Select Vector Elements

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10)
```

Select the first element:

```{r}
x[1]
```

Select the last element:

```{r}
x[length(x)]
```

Select a range of elements:

```{r}
x[1:3]
```

### Compare Two Vectors

`setdiff(x, y)` finds elements that are in vector `x` but not in vector `y`.

```{r}
xx = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
yy = c(2, 4)
setdiff(xx, yy)
```    
        

### Converting Between Vector Types

`as.*` functions are used to coerce vectors from one type to another.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "g", "b")
y = as.factor(x)
y
```

```{r}
x <- c('123', '44', '222')
y = as.numeric(x)
y
```





# 2. Data Frames

A data frame is a two-dimensional, **heterogeneous** data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. It is the most important data structure for data analysis in R.

-   Each column is a vector.
-   Each column can have a different data type.
-   All columns must have the same length.

## Creating Data Frames

Use the `data.frame()` function or, preferably, the `tibble()` function from the `tidyverse`. Tibbles are a modern take on data frames that are more user-friendly: they don't change variable names or types, and they have a much nicer print method.

```{r}
my_df <- tibble(
  id = 1:4,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"),
  score = c(95, 82, 78, 91),
  is_student = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

my_df
```

## Subsetting Data Frames

You can subset data frames in several ways:

-   `$` or `[[ ]]` to select a single column by name. This returns the column as a vector.
-   `[row, column]` to select specific rows and columns. The result is another data frame (or a vector if you select a single column).

```{r}
# Select the 'name' column (returns a vector)
my_df$name

# Select the first two rows and the 'name' and 'score' columns (returns a tibble)
my_df[1:2, c("name", "score")]
```

For more complex subsetting, it is highly recommended to use the `dplyr` verbs `filter()` and `select()` (covered in a separate guide).


## Data Frame to Matrix

Converting a data frame to a matrix will coerce all elements to the most flexible data type (usually character).

```{r}
mat <- as.matrix(my_df)
mat
```

## Data Frame to Vector

You can extract a single column as a vector using `$` or `[[ ]]` notation.

```{r}
vec = my_df[['name']]
vec
```



# 3. Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional, **homogeneous** data structure. All elements must be of the same type. It is most useful for mathematical and statistical operations, such as linear algebra.

### Creating Matrices

Use the `matrix()` function.

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(
    data = 1:12,      # The data to fill the matrix
    nrow = 3,         # The number of rows
    ncol = 4,         # The number of columns
    byrow = TRUE      # Fill the matrix row by row (default is by column)
)

my_matrix
```

### Subsetting Matrices

Subsetting is similar to data frames, using `[row, column]` notation.

```{r}
my_matrix[2, 3] # Element in the 2nd row, 3rd column

my_matrix[1, ] # The entire 1st row

my_matrix[, 4] # The entire 4th column
```

### Matrix Operations

Matrices support matrix algebra operations, such as transposition (`t()`) and matrix multiplication (`%*%`).

```{r}
t(my_matrix) # Transpose the matrix
```

# 4. Lists

A list is a one-dimensional, **heterogeneous** data structure. Unlike vectors, lists can contain elements of different types and even different structures, including other lists, vectors, or data frames. This makes them very flexible, like a container for other objects.

## Creating Lists

Use the `list()` function. It's good practice to name the list elements.

```{r}
# A list is often used to return multiple results from a function
my_model_output <- list(
  name = "Linear Model",
  coefficients = c(intercept = 2.5, slope = 0.8),
  r_squared = 0.85,
  data = head(mtcars)
)

my_model_output
```

## Subsetting Lists

Subsetting lists requires understanding the difference between `[` and `[[`:

-   `[[index]]` or `[[name]]` extracts a **single element** from the list. The result will have the type of that element.
-   `[index]` or `[name]` extracts a **sub-list**. The result is always another list, even if you only select one element.

```{r}
# Extract the 'coefficients' vector (result is a numeric vector)
my_model_output[["coefficients"]]

# Extract a sub-list containing only the 'coefficients' element (result is a list)
my_model_output["coefficients"]

# Use the $ operator as a convenient shortcut for [[name]]
my_model_output$r_squared
```

# 5. Arrays

An array is a multi-dimensional, **homogeneous** data structure. It can have two or more dimensions. A 2D array is essentially a matrix. Arrays are useful for storing data that has more than two dimensions, such as image data (height, width, color channels) or time series data for multiple locations.

## Creating Arrays

Use the `array()` function, specifying the data and the dimensions.

```{r}
# Create a 3D array (2 rows, 3 columns, 2 layers)
my_array <- array(
  data = 1:12, 
  dim = c(2, 3, 2)
)

my_array
```

## Subsetting Arrays

Elements are accessed using `[row, column, dimension]` notation.

```{r}
# Element in the 1st row, 2nd column of the 2nd layer
my_array[1, 2, 2]

# The entire first matrix (1st layer)
my_array[, , 1]
```

# 6. Inspecting Data Structures

Understanding the structure of your data is a critical first step in any analysis. R provides several useful functions for this.

-   `str()`: The most useful function. Provides a compact, human-readable summary of any R object.
-   `class()`: Returns the high-level class of an object.
-   `typeof()`: Returns the internal storage type.
-   `length()`: Returns the number of elements in a vector or list.
-   `dim()`: Returns the dimensions (e.g., rows and columns) of a data frame, matrix, or array.
-   `names()` or `colnames()`: Returns the names of elements or columns.

```{r}
str(my_df)
```

```{r}
str(my_model_output)
```

# 7. Choosing the Right Data Structure

| Use a...       | When you have...                                       | Example Use Case                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Vector**     | A 1D sequence of the **same data type**.               | A single column of data, like ages or names.        |
| **Data Frame** | A 2D table with columns of **different data types**.   | Your typical dataset for analysis.                  |
| **Matrix**     | A 2D grid of the **same data type**.                   | A correlation matrix, an image grayscale matrix.    |
| **List**       | A collection of **different types/structures**.        | To return multiple, varied objects from a function. |
| **Array**      | A multi-dimensional grid of the **same data type**.    | 3D medical imaging data, climate data over time.    |
