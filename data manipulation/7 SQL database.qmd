This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to connect to and interact with SQL databases directly from R. We will explore three primary methods: writing raw SQL queries, using the modern `dbplyr` package for a `tidyverse`-like experience, and using `sqldf` to query local data frames with SQL syntax.

# 1. Why Use a Database with R?

While R is excellent at in-memory data manipulation, connecting to a database is essential when:

-   **Data size is too large:** The dataset is too big to fit into your computer's RAM. Databases are optimized for storing and querying massive datasets efficiently.
-   **Data is centralized:** The data is stored in a central location, accessed by multiple users or applications, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
-   **Production environments:** You need to query or write to a production database system as part of an analytical workflow. The database handles tasks like security, backups, and concurrent access.

# 2. Connecting to a Database

The `DBI` (Database Interface) package provides a universal, consistent interface for connecting to any database. Specific driver packages like `RSQLite`, `RPostgres`, or `odbc` handle the connection to different database systems.

For these examples, we will use `RSQLite`, which creates a lightweight, file-based SQL database that is perfect for learning and demonstration.

```{r}
# Load the necessary libraries
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Create and Populate a Database

First, we establish a connection to a database file. If the file doesn't exist, `dbConnect()` will create it. Then, we'll copy the `mtcars` and `iris` R data frames into the database, creating new tables.

```{r}
# Add car names as a column in mtcars, as they are originally row names
mtcars_df <- mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "car_name")

# Create a connection to an SQLite database file in the 'data' subdirectory
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/my_sql_database.db")

# Write the R data frames to the database
# `overwrite = TRUE` will replace the table if it already exists
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars_df, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris, overwrite = TRUE)
```

We can list the tables to confirm they were successfully created.

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

# 3. Method 1: Writing Raw SQL Queries

This approach involves sending SQL statements as text strings to the database. The `dbGetQuery()` function executes the query and returns the result as a data frame in R.

## SELECT Statement

Select all columns (`*`) from the `mtcars` table. `LIMIT` restricts the output to the first 3 rows.

```{r}
sql_select <- "SELECT * FROM mtcars LIMIT 3"
dbGetQuery(con, sql_select)
```

## Column Aliasing and Creation

Use `AS` to rename a column in the query's output. You can also create new columns based on calculations on existing ones.

```{r}
sql_create_col <- "SELECT mpg, mpg * 0.425 AS kpl FROM mtcars" # Convert MPG to KPL
head(dbGetQuery(con, sql_create_col))
```

## Filtering with WHERE

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on one or more conditions. `AND` requires both conditions to be true.

```{r}
sql_filter <- "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE hp > 200 AND cyl = 8"
head(dbGetQuery(con, sql_filter))
```

## Aggregation with GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` is a powerful tool for summarizing data. It collapses multiple rows into a single summary row based on a grouping variable. It is almost always used with aggregate functions like `AVG()` (average), `COUNT()` (count), `MIN()` (minimum), and `MAX()` (maximum).

This query calculates the average horsepower and the number of cars for each cylinder group.

```{r}
sql_groupby <- "SELECT cyl, AVG(hp) AS avg_hp, COUNT(*) AS num_cars FROM mtcars GROUP BY cyl"
dbGetQuery(con, sql_groupby)
```

## Sorting with ORDER BY

`ORDER BY` sorts the result set. The default is ascending order (`ASC`), but you can specify `DESC` for descending order.

```{r}
sql_orderby <- "SELECT car_name, mpg, hp FROM mtcars ORDER BY hp DESC LIMIT 5"
dbGetQuery(con, sql_orderby)
```

## Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. We'll create two new tables to demonstrate.

```{r}
dbWriteTable(con, "car_parts", data.frame(car_name = c("Mazda RX4", "Datsun 710", "Hornet 4 Drive"), part_id = c(1, 2, 3)), overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(con, "part_info", data.frame(part_id = c(1, 2, 4), part_name = c("Engine", "Tire", "Brake")), overwrite = TRUE)
```

### INNER JOIN

Returns only the rows where the join key (`part_id`) exists in **both** tables.

```{r}
sql_inner_join <- "
SELECT cp.car_name, pi.part_name
FROM car_parts cp
INNER JOIN part_info pi ON cp.part_id = pi.part_id"
dbGetQuery(con, sql_inner_join)
```

### LEFT JOIN

Returns **all** rows from the left table (`car_parts`) and any matched rows from the right table (`part_info`). If there is no match, the columns from the right table will be `NA`.

```{r}
sql_left_join <- "
SELECT cp.car_name, pi.part_name
FROM car_parts cp
LEFT JOIN part_info pi ON cp.part_id = pi.part_id"
dbGetQuery(con, sql_left_join)
```

## Modifying Data

For SQL commands that modify data but do not return a result set (like `UPDATE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`), use the `dbExecute()` function.

### UPDATE Table

`UPDATE` modifies existing records in a table.

```{r}
# Set the horsepower to 120 for the 'Mazda RX4'
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE mtcars SET hp = 120 WHERE car_name = 'Mazda RX4'")

# Verify the change
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT car_name, hp FROM mtcars WHERE car_name = 'Mazda RX4'")
```

### CREATE and DROP Table

`CREATE TABLE` builds a new table, and `DROP TABLE` permanently deletes one.

```{r}
# Create a copy of the mtcars table
sql_create <- "CREATE TABLE mtcars_copy AS SELECT * FROM mtcars"
dbExecute(con, sql_create)
dbListTables(con)
```

```{r}
# Drop the copy
sql_drop <- "DROP TABLE mtcars_copy"
dbExecute(con, sql_drop)
dbListTables(con)
```

# 4. Method 2: Using `dbplyr` (Recommended)

`dbplyr` is a `tidyverse` backend for databases. It allows you to write familiar `dplyr` code, which `dbplyr` translates into SQL for you. This is the **recommended modern approach** because it is:

-   **Easier to write and read:** No need to remember the specific SQL dialect of your database.
-   **Less error-prone:** Avoids syntax errors from manually writing SQL strings.
-   **More secure:** Protects against SQL injection attacks automatically.
-   **Lazy evaluation:** `dbplyr` only sends the query to the database when you explicitly ask for the results, which can save a lot of computation.

First, we create a reference to the `mtcars` table in the database. This object is a pointer to the remote table; the data is not pulled into R yet.

```{r}
mtcars_db <- tbl(con, "mtcars")
```

Now, we can use `dplyr` verbs on this `mtcars_db` object. The R code is not executed in R; it is translated to SQL and sent to the database for execution.

```{r}
query <- mtcars_db %>%
  select(car_name, mpg, hp, cyl) %>%
  filter(hp > 150) %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_mpg))
```

We can use `show_query()` to inspect the SQL that `dbplyr` generated. This is a great way to learn SQL!

```{r}
show_query(query)
```

To execute the query and pull the results back into a standard R data frame, we use `collect()`.

```{r}
results <- collect(query)
results
```

# 5. Best Practice: Parameterized Queries

When you must write raw SQL, it is critical to avoid using functions like `paste()` or `glue()` to insert values directly into a query string. This practice makes you vulnerable to **SQL injection**, a serious security risk.

The correct and safe method is to use **parameterized queries**. You use a placeholder (`?`) in the SQL string and provide the values in a separate list.

```{r}
# Define the R variable to be used in the query
hp_threshold <- 150

# Write the SQL with a placeholder (?)
sql_safe <- "SELECT car_name, hp FROM mtcars WHERE hp > ?"

# Provide the variable in the `params` list. DBI handles the safe substitution.
dbGetQuery(con, sql_safe, params = list(hp_threshold)) %>% head()
```

# 6. Method 3: Using `sqldf` on Local Data Frames

The `sqldf` package offers a unique functionality: it allows you to run SQL queries on **local R data frames**, not on an external database. This can be a convenient tool for users who are more comfortable with SQL syntax than with `dplyr` for data manipulation tasks.

```{r}
library(sqldf)

# Note the use of the local R data frame `mtcars_df`, not a database connection
sqldf("SELECT car_name, mpg FROM mtcars_df WHERE cyl = 8 LIMIT 5")
```

# 7. Database Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. All the operations in a transaction must succeed; if any of them fail, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged. This ensures data integrity.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Start a transaction
dbBegin(con)

# Try to execute two statements
# The first will succeed, the second will fail because the table doesn't exist
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE mtcars SET hp = 999 WHERE car_name = 'Mazda RX4'")
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE non_existent_table SET col = 1")

# If there was an error, dbCommit will fail and you should rollback
# In a real script, you would wrap this in tryCatch()
# For this example, we manually rollback
dbRollback(con)

# Check the value - it should NOT be 999 because the transaction was rolled back
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT hp FROM mtcars WHERE car_name = 'Mazda RX4'")
```

# 8. Disconnecting from the Database

It is very important to close the database connection when you are finished. This releases resources on both your machine and the database server.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
