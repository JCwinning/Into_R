The `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This guide focuses on `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, and `lubridate`, the core packages for data manipulation.

# 1. `dplyr`: A Grammar of Data Manipulation

`dplyr` provides a consistent and intuitive grammar for data manipulation. Its functions, or "verbs," are easy to read and can be chained together using the pipe operator (`%>%`), which passes the result of one function as the first argument to the next.

## Load Packages and Data

First, we load the `tidyverse` suite of packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will use the built-in `mtcars` dataset. For clarity, we convert the row names to a proper column called `car_name`.

```{r}
data(mtcars)

small_mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  select(cyl, mpg, hp) %>% 
  head()

small_mtcars <- rownames_to_column(small_mtcars, var = "car_name")

mtcars_df <- mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "car_name") %>% 
  as_tibble() # Convert to a tibble for better printing

head(mtcars_df)
```

## Get Column Names

The `names()` function returns a character vector of the column names in a data frame.

```{r}
names(mtcars_df)
```



## `select()`: Pick columns by name

`select()` allows you to subset your data by choosing specific columns.

```{r}
# Select a few specific columns
mtcars_df %>% select(car_name, mpg, hp, cyl)
```

Use helper functions like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `contains()` for powerful selections.

```{r}
# Select all columns that start with the letter "d"
mtcars_df %>% select(starts_with("d"))
```

Use the `-` sign to deselect or drop columns.

```{r}
# Select all columns except `vs` and `am`
mtcars_df %>% select(-vs, -am)
```

## Select by Index

You can also select columns by their position.

```{r}
mtcars_df %>% select(1, 2) 
```

## Drop Columns

Use the `-` sign to deselect or drop columns.

```{r}
mtcars_df %>% select(-cyl)
```

## Rename Columns

The `rename()` verb changes the name of a column.

```{r}
mtcars_df %>% rename(new_cyl = cyl)
```


## `filter()`: Pick rows by condition

`filter()` subsets rows based on logical conditions. Only rows where the condition is `TRUE` are kept.

```{r}
# Filter for cars with 8 cylinders
mtcars_df %>% filter(cyl == 8)
```

Combine conditions with logical operators:
-   `,` or `&` for AND
-   `|` for OR
-   `!` for NOT

```{r}
# Filter for 8-cylinder cars with more than 200 horsepower
mtcars_df %>% filter(cyl == 8 & hp > 200)

# Filter for cars that are either 8-cylinder OR have more than 300 horsepower
mtcars_df %>% filter(cyl == 8 | hp > 300)
```

## `arrange()`: Reorder rows

`arrange()` sorts the rows of a data frame by one or more columns.

```{r}
# Sort cars by miles per gallon (mpg) in ascending order (the default)
mtcars_df %>% arrange(mpg)
```

Use `desc()` to sort in descending order.

```{r}
# Sort by cylinder count (desc) and then by mpg (desc) for tie-breaking
mtcars_df %>% arrange(desc(cyl), desc(mpg))
```

## `mutate()`: Create new columns

`mutate()` adds new columns or transforms existing ones, while keeping all existing columns.

```{r}
# Create a new column for horsepower-to-weight ratio
mtcars_df %>% mutate(hp_per_wt = hp / wt)
```

Use `case_when()` for complex conditional logic, which is like a more powerful version of an if-else statement.

```{r}
# Create a column for cylinder category
mtcars_df %>% mutate(cyl_group = case_when(
    cyl == 4 ~ "Four-Cylinder",
    cyl == 6 ~ "Six-Cylinder",
    cyl == 8 ~ "Eight-Cylinder",
    TRUE ~ "Other" # Fallback for any other case
  ))
```

## `summarise()` and `group_by()`: Collapse rows to a summary

This is one of the most powerful combinations in `dplyr`. `group_by()` groups the data by one or more variables. Subsequent operations are then performed on each group independently. `summarise()` then collapses each group into a single-row summary.

```{r}
# Calculate summary statistics for each cylinder group
mtcars_df %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_hp = median(hp, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_wt = min(wt, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_wt = max(wt, na.rm = TRUE),
    car_count = n() # n() counts the number of rows in the group
  )
```

## Joining Tables

`dplyr` provides a family of join functions to combine data from different tables.

```{r}
band_members_df <- tribble(
  ~name,     ~band, 
  "Mick",    "Stones",
  "John",    "Beatles",
  "Paul",    "Beatles"
)

band_instruments_df <- tribble(
  ~name,     ~plays, 
  "Mick",    "vocals",
  "John",    "guitar",
  "Keith",   "guitar"
)
```

-   `inner_join()`: Returns only the rows where the key exists in both tables.
-   `left_join()`: Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table.
-   `full_join()`: Returns all rows from both tables.
-   `anti_join()`: Returns all rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right table.

```{r}
# Left join to keep all members and see who plays an instrument
left_join(band_members_df, band_instruments_df, by = "name")

# Anti join to find which members are not in the instruments table
anti_join(band_members_df, band_instruments_df, by = "name")
```





# 2. `tidyr`: Tidy Your Data

`tidyr` provides tools for reshaping data. The goal is to create "tidy" data, which has a specific structure:
1.  Every column is a variable.
2.  Every row is an observation.
3.  Every cell is a single value.

```{r}
# Create a sample wide-format (untidy) dataset
wide_data <- read.table(header = TRUE, text = '
 subject sex control cond1 cond2
       1   M     7.9  12.3  10.7
       2   F     6.3  10.6  11.1
')
```

### `pivot_longer()`: Wide to Long

`pivot_longer()` makes data "longer" by gathering multiple columns into key-value pairs. This is often the first step to making data "tidy."

```{r}
long_data <- wide_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(control, cond1, cond2), # The columns to pivot
    names_to = 'condition',         # New column for the old column names
    values_to = 'measurement'       # New column for the old cell values
  )

long_data
```

### `pivot_wider()`: Long to Wide

`pivot_wider()` does the opposite, making data "wider" by spreading a key-value pair into multiple columns.

```{r}
long_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = condition,   # Column to get new column names from
    values_from = measurement # Column to get cell values from
  )
```

# 3. `stringr`: String Manipulation

`stringr` provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for common string operations, built on top of the `stringi` package.

![](images/logo-01.png)

```{r}
text_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pineapple")
```

-   `str_detect()`: Check for the presence of a pattern.
-   `str_replace()`: Replace the first match of a pattern.
-   `str_extract()`: Extract the first match of a pattern.
-   `str_split()`: Split a string into pieces.

```{r}
# Find elements containing "apple"
str_detect(text_vector, "apple")

# Extract numbers from a string using a regular expression
# \d+ is a regex for one or more digits
str_extract("Order_ID_12345", "\\d+") 

# Split a string by a delimiter
str_split("a-b-c", "-")
```

# 4. `lubridate`: Date and Time Manipulation

`lubridate` simplifies working with dates and times in R, which can otherwise be quite complex.

![](images/logo-02.png)

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```


## Today

```{r}
today()
```


-   **Parsing:** `ymd()`, `mdy()`, `dmy()` parse strings into dates reliably, automatically handling different separators.
-   **Component Extraction:** `year()`, `month()`, `day()`, `wday()` extract parts of a date.
-   **Arithmetic:** Perform calculations with date and time objects using `duration` and `period` objects.

```{r}
# Parse a date
date_obj <- ymd("2023-10-27")

# Get the day of the week
wday(date_obj, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)

# Add 15 days to the date
date_obj + days(15)

# Calculate the time difference between two dates
new_year <- ymd("2024-01-01")
interval(date_obj, new_year) / days(1)
```


# 5. Window Functions

Window functions are functions that operate on a "window" of data (e.g., within a group) but, unlike `summarise()`, they return a value for every row.

## Ranking with `row_number`

`row_number()` assigns a unique rank to each row within a group.

```{r}
small_mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(desc(mpg))) %>% 
  select(cyl, mpg, rank)
```

## Accessing Previous/Next Values with `lag` and `lead`

`lag()` and `lead()` are useful for comparing a value to its predecessor or successor.

```{r}
small_mtcars %>% 
  select(cyl, mpg) %>% 
  mutate(mpg_previous = lag(mpg, n = 1))
```

## Cumulative Summaries

`cumsum()` calculates the cumulative sum.

```{r}
small_mtcars %>% 
  select(cyl, mpg) %>% 
  mutate(mpg_running_total = cumsum(mpg))
```

## Order Rows

`arrange()` sorts the rows of a data frame by one or more columns.

```{r}
small_mtcars %>% arrange(cyl) 
```

Sort in descending order using `desc()`.

```{r}
small_mtcars %>% arrange(desc(cyl))
```


# 6. Handle Missing Data

Let's create a sample data frame with missing values (`NA`).

```{r}
missing_df <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, NA, 4),
  y = c("a", NA, "c", "d")
)
```

## Find Missing Data

`is.na()` returns a logical vector indicating which values are missing.

```{r}
is.na(missing_df)
```

## Filter Out Missing Data

You can use `filter()` with `!is.na()` to remove rows with missing values in a specific column.

```{r}
missing_df %>% filter(!is.na(y))
```

`tidyr::drop_na()` removes rows with any missing values.

```{r}
missing_df %>% drop_na()
```

# 7. Dataframe to Other Data Formats

## Dataframe to Vector

```{r}
data <- small_mtcars$cyl
data
```

```{r}
class(data)
```

## Dataframe to Matrix

```{r}
data=data.matrix(small_mtcars)
data
```

```{r}
class(data)
```

## Dataframe to List

```{r}
data=as.list(small_mtcars)
data
```

```{r}
class(data)
```
