Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur.

# Random Numbers

## Draw 10 numbers from 1 to 10

The `sample()` function is used to take a random sample from a vector. Here, we are sampling 10 numbers from the sequence 1 to 10. `replace = TRUE` means that after a number is drawn, it is put back into the pool and can be drawn again.

```{r}
a = sample(1:10, 10, replace = TRUE)
a
```

This code creates a frequency table to show how many times each number was drawn. With a small sample size, the distribution might not be perfectly even.

```{r}
as.data.frame(table(a))
```

## Draw 10,000 numbers from 1 to 10

By increasing the sample size to 10,000, the law of large numbers suggests that the frequency of each number will be much closer to 10%.

```{r}
a = sample(1:10, 10000, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
as.data.frame(table(a))
```

# Permutations and Combinations

![](images/clipboard-2817248623.png)

## Permutations (order matters): choosing 2 numbers from 4

The `gtools::permutations()` function calculates the number of ways to choose and arrange `r` items from a set of `n` items. The formula is n! / (n-r)!.

```{r}
library(gtools)
all_num = 4
choose = 2

res <- permutations(n = all_num, r = choose, v = 1:all_num)
res
```

The number of permutations is 12.

```{r}
print(nrow(res))
```

This can be calculated manually using the formula 4! / (4-2)!.

```{r}
factorial(4) / factorial(4 - 2)
```

## Combinations (order does not matter): choosing 2 numbers from 4

The `gtools::combinations()` function calculates the number of ways to choose `r` items from a set of `n` items, where order does not matter. The formula is n! / ((n-r)! * r!).

```{r}
library(gtools)
all_num = 4
choose = 2

res <- combinations(n = all_num, r = choose, v = 1:all_num)
res
```

The number of combinations is 6.

```{r}
print(nrow(res))
```

This can be calculated manually using the formula 4! / ((4-2)! * 2!).

```{r}
factorial(4) / (factorial(4 - 2) * factorial(2))
```

# Conditional Probability

**Problem**: The probability of any single person snoring is 20%. If there are 4 people in a room, what is the probability that at least one person snores?

```{r}
p = 0.2
n = 4
```

## Solution 1: P(at least one) = P(1 snoring) + P(2 snoring) + P(3 snoring) + P(4 snoring)

This method calculates the probability of each case (1, 2, 3, or 4 people snoring) and adds them together.

### 0 snoring

```{r}
p0 = (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8)
p0
```

### 1 snoring

There are 4 possible ways for exactly one person to snore.

```{r}
p1 = (0.2 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) * 4
p1
```

### 2 snoring

There are C(4,2) = 6 ways for exactly two people to snore.

```{r}
factorial(4) / (factorial(4 - 2) * factorial(2))
```

```{r}
p2 = (0.2 * 0.2 * 0.8 * 0.8) * 6
p2
```

### 3 snoring

There are C(4,3) = 4 ways for exactly three people to snore.

```{r}
factorial(4) / (factorial(4 - 3) * factorial(3))
```

```{r}
p3 = (0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.8) * 4
p3
```

### 4 snoring

```{r}
p4 = (0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2)
p4
```

### Total probability of at least one person snoring:

```{r}
P_at_least_one = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
P_at_least_one
```

## Solution 2: P(at least one) = 1 - P(no one snoring)

This is a more direct method. The complement of "at least one" is "none".

```{r}
P_at_least_one2 = 1 - (0.8^4)
P_at_least_one2
```

# Derangement Problem

A derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

## Question 1: What is the probability of choosing 4 numbers from 4 and getting 0 correct (all wrong)?

The total number of permutations is 4! = 24.

```{r}
factorial(4)
```

The number of derangements D(n) can be approximated by `round(n!/e)`. For n=4, this is D(4) = 9.

```{r}
e = exp(1) # Use the built-in constant for e
D_4 = round(factorial(4) / e)
D_4
```

The probability of a complete derangement is the number of derangements divided by the total number of permutations.

```{r}
Q1 = D_4 / factorial(4)
Q1
```

## Question 2: What is the probability of choosing 4 numbers from 4 and getting exactly 1 correct?

First, choose 1 number to be correct (C(4,1) = 4 ways). Then, find the number of derangements for the remaining 3 numbers (D(3) = 2).

```{r}
D_3 = round(factorial(3) / e)
D_3
```

The total number of ways to get exactly 1 correct is C(4,1) * D(3) = 4 * 2 = 8.

```{r}
Q2 = (4 * D_3) / factorial(4)
Q2
```

## Question 3: What is the probability of choosing 4 numbers from 4 and getting exactly 2 correct?

First, choose 2 numbers to be correct (C(4,2) = 6 ways). Then, find the number of derangements for the remaining 2 numbers (D(2) = 1).

```{r}
D_2 = round(factorial(2) / e)
C_4_2 = factorial(4) / (factorial(2) * factorial(2))
Q3 = (C_4_2 * D_2) / factorial(4)
Q3
```

## Question 4: What is the probability of choosing 4 numbers from 4 and getting exactly 3 correct?

This is impossible. If 3 numbers are in their correct positions, the 4th number must also be in its correct position. The number of derangements of 1 item is D(1) = 0.

```{r}
Q4 = 0
Q4
```

## Question 5: What is the probability of choosing 4 numbers from 4 and getting all 4 correct?

There is only one way for this to happen.

```{r}
Q5 = 1 / factorial(4)
Q5
```

The sum of all probabilities should be 1.

```{r}
Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5
```

# Distributions

## Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with a binary outcome (success/failure).

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

In R, the `dbinom` function calculates the probability of getting exactly `x` successes. While this is technically a PMF for a discrete distribution, R uses the `d` prefix convention for both PDF (continuous) and PMF (discrete).

Probability of exactly 1 person snoring:

```{r}
n = 4 # number of trials (people)
p = 0.2 # probability of success (snoring)

dbinom(x = 1, size = n, prob = p)
```

Probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 people snoring:

```{r}
dbinom(x = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4), size = n, prob = p)
```

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The `pbinom` function calculates the cumulative probability of getting `q` or fewer successes.

Probability of 1 or fewer people snoring:

```{r}
pbinom(q = 1, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

### Random Number Generation

The `rbinom` function generates random numbers from a binomial distribution.

Generate 10,000 random values from this distribution:

```{r}
a = rbinom(10000, size = 4, prob = 0.2)
table(a)
```

## Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)

A continuous probability distribution characterized by a bell-shaped curve. It is defined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

### R Functions

- `dnorm`: Density function (PDF)
- `pnorm`: Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
- `qnorm`: Quantile function (inverse CDF)
- `rnorm`: Random number generation

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

Calculates the height of the probability density function at a given point.

```{r}
dnorm(0, mean = 1, sd = 2)
```

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

Calculates the area under the curve to the left of a given value (the probability of observing a value less than or equal to `q`).

Probability of observing a value <= 70 from a N(75, 5) distribution:

```{r}
pnorm(q = 70, mean = 75, sd = 5)
```

### Quantile Function

Finds the value `x` such that P(X <= x) = p. It is the inverse of the CDF.

Find the 25th percentile (Q1) of a N(75, 5) distribution:

```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.25, mean = 75, sd = 5)
```

### Random Number Generation

Generate 1,000 random numbers from a N(75, 5) distribution and plot a histogram.

```{r}
nd = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 75, sd = 5)
hist(nd)
```

### Checking for Normality

It's often important to check if a dataset follows a normal distribution.

```{r}
nd_data = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 2)
non_nd_data = rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 5) # Poisson data is not normal
```

#### Method 1: Histogram
A bell-shaped histogram suggests normality.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(nd_data, col = 'steelblue', main = 'Normal')
hist(non_nd_data, col = 'darkred', main = 'Non-normal')
```

#### Method 2: Q-Q Plot
If the data is normal, the points on a Q-Q plot will fall closely along the straight line.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
qqnorm(nd_data, main = 'Normal')
qqline(nd_data)
qqnorm(non_nd_data, main = 'Non-normal')
qqline(non_nd_data)
```

#### Method 3: Shapiro-Wilk Test
A statistical test for normality. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the data is normally distributed.

If the p-value is > 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

```{r}
shapiro.test(nd_data)
```

If the p-value is < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

```{r}
shapiro.test(non_nd_data)
```

## Other Key Distributions

- **Student's t-distribution**: Used for inference about the mean of a normally distributed population when the standard deviation is unknown.
- **F-distribution**: Used in ANOVA to compare the means of multiple groups.
- **Chi-square distribution**: Used in goodness-of-fit tests and tests of independence.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
